# Speed Control of DC Motor Using Arduino

## About The Project

In this project, we demonstrated how to achieve Speed and Direction Control of a DC Motor using Arduino UNO. It is a simple project using Arduino UNO and a few easily available components to control the speed of rotation of a DC motor and also its direction of rotation.
